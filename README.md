# 50 AI Products in 50 Days

Building 50 AI-powered applications in 50 days — one app per day — to demonstrate speed, consistency, and applied product thinking.

---

## 👋 About

I’m **Layan Khalil**, an AI Product Builder focused on turning ideas into working AI-powered tools.

This repository documents a personal challenge where I build and ship **one functional AI application every day for 50 days**.

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to:
- Practice fast and intentional product execution
- Observe how real users interact with AI-powered tools
- Identify which ideas show **strong product potential** over time

This is a learning and experimentation process, not a startup launch.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Each application:
- Solves one clearly defined problem
- Is built and shipped within a single day
- Is released as a working demo for real-world testing
- Focuses on usefulness and decision support
- Keeps core logic and internal implementation private
  
## AI Models & Tooling
Some applications leverage large language models (LLMs) such as **Gemini 2.5** to support analysis, reasoning, or content generation.
Models are used as assisting components within a broader product flow — not as standalone outputs.
Exact prompts, configurations, and internal logic are intentionally not disclosed.

---

## 🔓 Public Demos

🔓 Public Demos
Some applications are deployed as public demos to allow testing and feedback.
They may utilize AI models (e.g., Gemini 2.5) for specific tasks.
Source code, prompts, and internal logic are intentionally not shared.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All tools are experimental and provided as-is.  
They are not intended for medical, legal, or professional use.
